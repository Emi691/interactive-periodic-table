Does it state intent
You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.
